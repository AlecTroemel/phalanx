#
# a gamestate consists of a table with these (all optional) methods
#
# init:   Called once, and only once, before entering the state the first time. See Gamestate.switch().
# enter:  Called every time when entering the state. See Gamestate.switch().
# leave:  Called when leaving a state. See Gamestate.switch() and Gamestate.pop().
# resume: Called when re-entering a state by Gamestate.pop()-ing another state.
# update: Update the game state. Called every frame.
# draw:   Draw on the screen. Called every frame.
